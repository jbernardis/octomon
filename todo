interaction with plugins
	time lapse??? - done but need to debug

determine how to handle if tool numbering starts at 1 instead of 0

need a working marlin for following:
	file upload - allow directory creation/traversal
	allow upload to sd - also allow delete and select
	the printer status report tells us if the sd is ready - should use that to enable/disable

Need to make sure when downloading the selected file for gcode monitor that subdirectories are represented in the job update.   Right now, I see origin and name, not path

question - if I select a new file while paused, does the printer state move to operational, or does it stay paused?  This is a potential issue because I need to
know when to enable print versus restart.
